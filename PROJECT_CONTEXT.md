## üéØ PROJECT IDENTITY

**Name:** PainChek Tracker  
**Folder:** `/Users/jonathonmarsden/Projects/painchek-tracker/`  
**Type:** React SPA (single HTML file with CDN imports)  
**Category:** Portfolio Project

---

## üåü PURPOSE & VISION

### What It Is:
A private stock portfolio tracker specifically for PainChek (ASX:PCK) shares. Helps investors track multiple purchases, calculate average buy price, and monitor current value with real-time price updates.

### Why It Exists:
- **Primary Goal:** Portfolio piece to demonstrate React proficiency to employers
- **Use Case:** Functional tool for PCK investors to track their holdings privately
- **Showcase Value:** Shows clean React code, component design, state management, and practical problem-solving

### Target Audience:
- Potential employers reviewing portfolio (primary)
- PainChek investors needing a simple tracker (secondary)

## üîó URLS & DEPLOYMENT

### Live URLs:
- **Primary App:** https://painchek.jonathonmarsden.com (NEW - added Oct 7, 2025)
- **Legacy URL:** https://painchek-tracker.netlify.app (ORIGINAL - still active)
- **Showcase Page:** https://jonathonmarsden.com/projects/painchek (pending)
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/jonathonmarsden/painchek-tracker

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: localStorage Migration Issue
**Problem:** Both URLs are live, but localStorage is domain-specific. Users who had data at the Netlify URL won't see it at the custom domain URL.

**Impact:** Users reported missing tranches after visiting the new domain (Oct 8, 2025).

**Root Cause:**
- `painchek-tracker.netlify.app` localStorage ‚â† `painchek.jonathonmarsden.com` localStorage
- Data doesn't automatically transfer between domains
- Users need to export from old URL and import to new URL

**Solution Options:**
1. Add migration helper banner in app
2. Redirect old domain to new (users must export first)
3. Document manual export/import process
4. Keep both URLs active (users choose)

### Deployment:
- **Platform:** Netlify
- **Connected to:** GitHub (auto-deploy on push)
- **Custom Domain:** painchek.jonathonmarsden.com (via Cloudflare DNS)
- **HTTPS:** Automatic (Netlify SSL)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed (Oct 7, 2025)

## üì¶ TECH STACK

**Core Technologies:**
- **Framework:** React 18 (via CDN - unpkg.com)

## üìù NOTES & LEARNINGS

### What Went Well:
- Single HTML file approach makes deployment trivial
- Local storage works perfectly for this use case
- Clean component structure even in single file
- Tailwind makes responsive design easy

### Challenges Faced:
- Calculating weighted average price correctly
- Deciding between local storage vs. backend
- Making the UI simple but functional

### Key Learnings:
- Not every React app needs a build process
- CDN imports work great for simple apps
- Local storage is powerful for privacy-first apps
- Single file can be well-structured

### Would Do Differently:
- Maybe add TypeScript from the start
- Consider adding chart visualization
- Could use a backend for price updates
