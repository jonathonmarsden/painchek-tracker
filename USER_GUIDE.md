## Features Guide

### üìä Portfolio Management

#### Adding a Tranche

**What is a "tranche"?**
A "tranche" (pronounced "transh") is simply a single purchase of shares. It's a French word meaning "slice" or "portion." In investing, it means one batch of shares you bought at a specific time and price.

**Think of it like this:**
- You buy PCK shares on 3 different days at 3 different prices
- Each purchase is a separate "tranche"
- The app tracks each one individually so you can see which buys were good deals

**Example:**
- **Tranche 1:** Sept 15, 2024 - Bought 1,000 shares @ $0.235 (total: $235)
- **Tranche 2:** Oct 1, 2024 - Bought 500 shares @ $0.242 (total: $121)
- **Tranche 3:** Oct 20, 2024 - Bought 750 shares @ $0.228 (total: $171)

If current price is $0.240:
- Tranche 1: $5 profit (good buy!)
- Tranche 2: -$1 loss (bought too high)
- Tranche 3: $9 profit (great buy!)

**Why track tranches separately?**
1. **See which purchases were smart** - Learn from your buying decisions
2. **Understand your cost basis** - Know your average purchase price
3. **Tax reporting** - Some countries have different tax rules for shares held different lengths of time
4. **Investment strategy** - Helps you decide when the price is good to buy more

**When to create separate tranches:**
- ‚úÖ Bought on different dates (even if same price)
- ‚úÖ Bought at different prices (even if same day)
- ‚úÖ Used different trading strategies (e.g., one via broker, one via DRP)

**When NOT to create separate tranches:**
- ‚ùå Same day, same price, same order = one tranche only

#### Auto Price Lookup
If you forget your purchase price:
1. Leave the "Purchase Price" field blank
2. App fetches actual closing price from Yahoo Finance for that date
3. If unavailable, you'll be prompted to enter it manually

#### Deleting a Tranche
Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to any tranche to remove it. **Warning:** This cannot be undone!

#### Exporting Your Portfolio
Click **"Export CSV"** to download your portfolio data:
- Purchase dates
- Number of shares
- Purchase prices
- Current values
- Gains/losses

**Use cases:**
- Backup your data
- Tax reporting (capital gains/losses)
- Share with your accountant
- Import into spreadsheet software

### üìà Charts & Analytics

#### Portfolio Performance Chart

**What it shows:**
This chart displays two lines over time:
- **Blue line** = Your portfolio's current value (how much your shares are worth today)
- **Grey dashed line** = Your total invested amount (how much money you put in)

**How to read it (for beginners):**

*Scenario 1: Making Money üí∞*
- Blue line is **above** grey line
- **Gap = Your profit**
- Example: Invested $500, current value $600 ‚Üí $100 profit (20% gain)

*Scenario 2: Losing Money üìâ*
- Blue line is **below** grey line
- **Gap = Your loss**
- Example: Invested $500, current value $450 ‚Üí $50 loss (10% loss)

*Scenario 3: Breaking Even*
- Blue line **touches** grey line
- No profit, no loss

**What the chart tells you:**
1. **Trend direction** - Is your investment getting better or worse over time?
   - Lines moving up = Stock price rising
   - Lines moving down = Stock price falling
   - Lines flat = Price staying steady

2. **Your timing** - Did you buy at good times?
   - If you bought when blue line was low and it's risen ‚Üí Good timing!
   - If you bought when blue line was high and it's fallen ‚Üí Bad timing (but hold on, it might recover!)

3. **When to act** (combined with your own research and financial advice):
   - Blue way above grey, near peak ‚Üí Some investors consider taking profits
   - Blue way below grey, near bottom ‚Üí Some investors consider buying more (dollar-cost averaging)
   - Blue and grey parallel ‚Üí Your investment is stable, neither growing nor shrinking much

**Why this chart matters:**
- **Visual proof of performance** - See at a glance if you're winning or losing
- **Emotional check** - Helps you stay rational during market swings
- **Strategy validation** - Shows if your investment approach is working long-term

**Important reminder:**
This chart shows **past performance only**. It cannot predict future movements. A rising blue line doesn't guarantee continued growth.

#### Price Chart
**Shows:** PCK stock price over the last 12 months

**How to read:**
- **Upward slope** = Bull market (price rising)
- **Downward slope** = Bear market (price falling)
- **Flat** = Sideways/consolidation (indecision)

**Why it matters:**
Helps you spot trends. Is now a good time to buy more? Is the stock recovering?

#### Volume Chart

**What it shows:**
The number of PCK shares bought and sold each day. High bars = lots of trading, low bars = quiet day.

**Why volume matters (explained for beginners):**

Volume tells you **how much interest** there is in the stock:

1. **High Volume = Many people trading**
   - Could mean important news just came out
   - Could mean investors are excited or worried
   - More certainty in price movements

2. **Low Volume = Few people trading**
   - Quiet day, no major news
   - Less certainty in price movements
   - Price changes might not be meaningful

**How to read volume patterns:**

*Pattern 1: Volume Spike + Price Goes UP* üìà
- **What it means:** Strong buying interest, people want to buy
- **Investor sentiment:** Bullish (positive/optimistic)
- **Possible reasons:** Good news, positive announcement, market excitement
- **What some investors do:** Watch for confirmation before joining the buying

*Pattern 2: Volume Spike + Price Goes DOWN* üìâ
- **What it means:** Strong selling pressure, people want to sell
- **Investor sentiment:** Bearish (negative/pessimistic)
- **Possible reasons:** Bad news, disappointing announcement, market fear
- **What some investors do:** Wait for the panic to settle, then assess if it's an opportunity

*Pattern 3: Volume Spike + Price Stays Flat*
- **What it means:** Battle between buyers and sellers, neither side winning
- **Investor sentiment:** Uncertainty, indecision
- **Possible reasons:** Mixed news, waiting for clarification
- **What some investors do:** Wait and watch for direction

*Pattern 4: Low Volume + Any Price Movement*
- **What it means:** Price change might not be meaningful (too few trades)
- **Caution:** Don't read too much into it
- **What some investors do:** Wait for volume confirmation

**Volume and announcements:**
- Volume often **spikes BEFORE** major ASX announcements (insiders, leaks, rumors)
- Check "Recent Announcements" section when you see unusual volume
- Compare: Did announcement come out the same day as volume spike?

**Pro tip for beginners:**
Think of volume like a "confidence meter" for price changes:
- High volume price increase = Strong confidence it will continue up
- Low volume price increase = Weak confidence, might reverse
- High volume price decrease = Strong selling pressure, might continue down
- Low volume price decrease = Weak selling, might recover quickly

**Remember:** Volume analysis is just one tool. Always combine with other research and never rely on it alone for decisions.

### üéØ Quick Stats Panel

Located below the main header, shows key metrics:

#### Total Shares
Combined shares across all your tranches.

**Example:**
- Tranche 1: 1,000 shares
- Tranche 2: 500 shares
- **Total: 1,500 shares**

#### Average Cost Basis
Your average purchase price per share across all tranches.

**Formula:** Total Money Spent √∑ Total Shares

**Example:**
- Tranche 1: 1,000 shares @ $0.235 = $235
- Tranche 2: 500 shares @ $0.242 = $121
- **Total: $356 √∑ 1,500 shares = $0.237 per share**

**Why it matters:** This is your break-even point. If current price is above this, you're profitable!

#### Break-Even Price
Same as Average Cost Basis. The price PCK needs to reach for you to break even.

#### Days Held
How many days since your **first** purchase.

**Example:** First buy on Sept 15, 2024. Today is Oct 7, 2025.
- **Days Held: 22 days**

**Why it matters:**
- Tax implications (capital gains tax rates differ for <12 months vs >12 months)
- Long-term investing mindset

#### Days Since Last Purchase
How many days since your **most recent** purchase.

**Why it matters:**
Reminder to dollar-cost average (DCA). If it's been 30+ days, the app suggests considering another purchase if you believe in the long-term potential.

---

### üîî Price Alerts

Set target prices and get notified when reached.

#### Setting Alerts
1. Click **"Set Alerts"** in the Price Alerts section
2. Enter your targets:
   - **High Alert**: Price you hope to reach (e.g., $0.50 for profit-taking)
   - **Low Alert**: Price you'd buy more at (e.g., $0.20 for averaging down)
3. Click **"Save Alerts"**

#### How Alerts Work
- **NOT real-time push notifications**
- Alerts check when you **open the app**
- If price hit your target since last visit, a **yellow banner** appears at top

**Example:**
- You set High Alert = $0.50
- Current price = $0.30
- *Two days later*, price hits $0.52
- When you next open the app, you see: "‚ö†Ô∏è Price reached your HIGH alert of $0.50!"

**Pro tip:** Check the app daily if you have active alerts!

---

### üì∞ ASX Announcements

Auto-fetched from the official ASX website, updated every 5 minutes.

#### How to Read Announcements

**Regular Announcements (Blue)**
- Company updates
- Quarterly reports
- Director changes
- Buy-backs

**Price-Sensitive Announcements (Red with ‚ö†Ô∏è icon)**
- Trading halts
- Major contracts
- Revenue updates
- FDA approvals
- Capital raises

**Why red matters:** These announcements can significantly move the stock price. Read them carefully!

#### Clicking Announcements
Click any announcement to open the official PDF from ASX. This is the same document professional investors read.

## Privacy & Data

### What Data Is Stored?

**Locally on YOUR device (in browser localStorage):**
- Your tranches (dates, shares, prices)
- Your price alerts
- No passwords
- No personal information
- No account details

**What Gets Sent to APIs:**
- Stock symbol "PCK.AX" ‚Üí Yahoo Finance (for price data)
- Company code "PCK" ‚Üí ASX (for announcements)
- **Nothing about your actual holdings**

### What Happens to My Data?

**Short answer:** It never leaves your device.

**Long answer:**
- Stored in browser's localStorage (like cookies but for data)
- Not transmitted to any server
- Not backed up to cloud
- Not synced across devices
- Not accessible to websites on other domains

**If you clear browser data, your portfolio is deleted.** Export to CSV regularly as backup!

### Is It Safe?

Yes! Security features:
- ‚úÖ All calculations happen locally
- ‚úÖ No login = no password to steal
- ‚úÖ No server = no database to hack
- ‚úÖ React prevents XSS attacks
- ‚úÖ Input validation on all forms
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured (Netlify)

**Biggest risk:** Accidentally clearing browser data. Export to CSV as backup!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to Load Stock Data"

**Possible causes:**
1. Yahoo Finance API is down (rare)
2. Internet connection issue
3. CORS proxy offline

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Click **"Try Again"** button
3. Wait a few minutes and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Can I still use the app?**
Yes! You can:
- View existing tranches
- See your portfolio data
- Export to CSV
- Delete tranches

You just won't see updated prices until the API is back.

---

### Charts Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Chart.js library failed to load
2. Browser doesn't support Canvas API
3. JavaScript error

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Update to latest browser version
4. Try Chrome/Firefox (best compatibility)

---

### Announcements Not Updating

**Possible causes:**
1. ASX website changed structure (scraping broke)
2. CORS proxy issue
3. Network problem

**Solution:**
- App shows fallback announcements (cached)
- Visit ASX directly: https://www.asx.com.au/markets/company/PCK
- Check back later - usually resolves within hours

---

### Price Alerts Not Triggering

**This is not a bug!** Alerts only work when you **open the app**.

**How it works:**
1. You set alert for $0.50
2. You close the app
3. Price hits $0.50 (you don't know yet)
4. **Next time you open the app**, banner appears: "Price hit $0.50!"

**Solution:** Check the app daily if you have active alerts.

**Why not real-time?**
- Would require backend server (defeats privacy purpose)
- Would need push notification permissions
- Would drain battery on mobile

---

### Data Lost After Browser Update

**Cause:** Browser update sometimes clears localStorage (rare but possible)

**Prevention:**
1. **Export to CSV monthly** as backup
2. Save CSV to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
3. Re-import manually if needed

**Solution:**
If data lost, manually re-add tranches from your CSV backup.

---

## FAQ

### Can I track multiple stocks?
**No.** This app is built specifically for PCK. You'd need to modify the source code to track other stocks.

### Does data sync across devices?
**No.** Each device has its own localStorage. Your phone and laptop have separate portfolios.

**Workaround:** Export CSV on one device, manually import on the other.

### Why is the price delayed?
**ASX exchange rules.** Free data feeds must be delayed 15-20 minutes. Real-time data requires expensive subscriptions ($$$).

### Can I use this for tax purposes?
**The exported CSV is accurate** (dates, shares, prices, gains/losses), but:
- ‚ùå Not tax advice (consult accountant)
- ‚ùå Double-check all numbers
- ‚úÖ Useful as starting point for tax forms

### What if PCK is delisted or acquired?
App will continue to work with last known price. You can still:
- Export your data
- See historical performance
- Calculate final gains/losses

### Is there an app for iOS/Android?
**No native apps**, but you can add the web app to your home screen:

**iOS (Safari):**
1. Tap Share icon (box with arrow)
2. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
3. Name it "PCK Tracker"
4. Tap "Add"

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Tap menu (‚ãÆ)
2. Tap "Add to Home screen"
3. Name it "PCK Tracker"
4. Tap "Add"

The app icon appears on your home screen and behaves like a native app!

### Can I change the currency?
**No.** App is hardcoded for AUD (Australian Dollars) since PCK trades on ASX.

### What happens if Yahoo Finance shuts down?
Price updates would stop working. You'd need to:
- Manually update prices
- Use alternative API (requires code changes)

**Likelihood:** Very low. Yahoo Finance is industry standard and has been running for 20+ years.

### How accurate are the calculations?
- **Prices**: As accurate as Yahoo Finance (cross-verified with ASX, typically exact)
- **Calculations**: Exact (no rounding until display)
- **Dates**: Day-level accuracy (no intraday tracking)

### Can I import data from my broker?
**Not automatically.** You need to manually enter each tranche. Most brokers provide CSV exports you can reference.

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Export Regularly
Export to CSV monthly and save to cloud storage. If you accidentally clear browser data, you have a backup.

### 2. Track Each Purchase Separately
Don't lump multiple purchases into one tranche. Separate tranches show which buys were smart and which weren't.

### 3. Check "Days Since Last Purchase"
If it's been 30+ days and you believe in PCK long-term, consider dollar-cost averaging with another purchase.

### 4. Watch Volume + Announcements
Big volume spike? Check Recent Announcements. Often news breaks that explains unusual trading.

### 5. Use Avg Cost Basis as Reference
- Current price **above** Avg Cost Basis = You're profitable
- Current price **at** Avg Cost Basis = Consider buying more (averaging down)
- Current price **way below** Avg Cost Basis = Reassess investment thesis

### 6. Set Realistic Price Alerts
Don't set High Alert at $10 when price is $0.25. Set achievable targets based on resistance levels or your target return.

### 7. Add to Home Screen (Mobile)
For quick access, add the web app to your phone's home screen. Feels like a native app!

---

## Advanced Features

### localStorage Quota Warning
If you're using >80% of your browser's storage (5MB limit), app warns you:

> "You're using 82% of your browser's storage limit (4.1MB of 5MB). Consider exporting your data to CSV as a backup."

**What to do:**
1. Export to CSV immediately
2. Delete old tranches you don't need
3. Clear browser cache (NOT localStorage unless you have backup!)

**Likelihood:** Very rare. Typical portfolio uses <100KB.

### Request Throttling
App automatically prevents API spam:
- Minimum 2 seconds between price fetch requests
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Manual refresh throttled to prevent abuse

**You'll never see this,** but it protects Yahoo Finance and ASX from getting angry at us!

### Error Boundary
If React crashes, you see a friendly error screen instead of blank page:

> "Something went wrong. The app encountered an unexpected error. Please try refreshing the page."

With a **"Refresh Page"** button. Your data is safe!
