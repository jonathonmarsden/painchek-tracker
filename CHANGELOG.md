## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-08

### üîí Security & Stability (MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS)

#### Added
- **Netlify Functions** - Replaced third-party CORS proxy (corsproxy.io) with self-hosted Netlify Functions

  - `asx-proxy.js` - Proxies ASX announcements with input validation and caching
  - Better security: Input validation on server-side
  - Better reliability: No third-party dependency
  - Better performance: Response caching (1min stocks, 5min news)

- **Comprehensive Input Validation** - Prevents corrupt localStorage data
  - Validates date: not in future, not before 1900, valid format
  - Validates shares: positive number, under 1 billion
  - Validates price: positive, under $10,000 (reasonable for PCK)
  - Shows all validation errors at once (not just first)

- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** - Handles network failures gracefully
  - 3 attempts max for all API calls
  - Backoff timing: 1s, 2s, 4s between retries

  - Prevents silent failures

#### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Historical price lookup** - Was completely broken!
  - Bug: Grabbed first price from 5-year dataset instead of matching purchase date
